  <h2>My two longtime favorite bands</h2>
  <p>The two bands I decided to add to my website are bands that have been a part of my life since I was a young girl.
    I know the members and lyrics off the top of my head. They are two bands I wish I could attend every single concert 
    they perform. Rock music takes many forms and the two bands here are an example of just that. Alice in Chains is grunge. 
    Cage the Elephant is indie. While both of their respective labels or categorizations aren't the best, it will suffice.

    <h5>Cage the Elephant</h5>
      </a>
    <h3>Next to make it big in rock n roll</h3>
    <p>My inspiration, to say the least. They do a wonderful job of conveying emotions through their lyrics. Matt Shultz,
    in particular, is the most visibly emotion driven on stage. He truly makes an effort to make a connection to the
    crowd when he performs. At the concert I attended, he ran all the way up to the nosebleeds to interact with fans.</p>

    <h3>Grunge legends</h3>
    <p>They have my heart. Alice in Chains is definitely one of those bands that I tend to listen to everyday. But when I do go
    a period of time without listening to them, I fall in love with them all over again. Probably bias, because I am a fan,
    but I would say they do not have one bad song -- with or without Staley.</p>
