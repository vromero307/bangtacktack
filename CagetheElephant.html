    <p> Interestingly enough, the two founders of the band are brothers. I think it's awesome because you can really 
      see the brotherly connection on stage when they perform. On another note, their fashion styles are completely different
      which makes for an interesting juxtaposition. When I went to go see them live, Matt had on a bee suit (the type you
      wear when you gather honey) that he slowly took off through the performance to reveal a nude, mummy-like leotard. 
      Brad, on the other hand, wore a black button down.

    <h3>The songs that put them on the map</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Shake Me Down
    </li><li>
    Ain't No Rest for the Wicked</li>
    <li>Come a Little Closer Than You See</li>
    </ol>
   <p> The song that picqued my interest was Ain't No Rest for the Wicked. Although an outlier from what they usually do,
     it made for good radio. I have all the lyrics memorized (as a true fan would). Their most recent album, Tell Me I'm Pretty,
     is vastly different from their earlier works. Thank You, Happy Birthday, an early album I have on vinyl, is more upbeat.
     In Tell Me I'm Pretty, the band covers more mature topics (e.g., divorce, death). Cage the Elephant has yet to disappoint me.

      <h3>Concerts</h3>
  </section><p>I wish I could say I have been to all their LA shows but unfortunately I have not. 
    I had the opportunity to go this summer to go to their show in Irvine at the 
    FivePoint Amphitheater. I got 8th row. It was unlike any other show I have been to! It was a trifecta 
    of talent: Spoon, Beck, and Cage the Elephant. I got to rock out with Brad Shultz in the aisle and touch Matt Shultz
    as he ran by. Super surreal time. I never thought I would see those three bands perform together. A perfect 
    combination.
