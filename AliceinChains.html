  <h3>Members</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Layne Staley</li>
      <li>Jerry Cantrell</li>
      <li>Mike Starr</li>
      <li>William DuVall</li>
      <li>Mike Inez</li>
     </ol>
    <p> Staley passed away in 2002 from a drug overdose. In 2006, DuVall took over as lead vocalist. However, I would
      like to note that he has not taken the limelight away from Cantrell, the last original Alice in Chains member as
      Starr also died of an overdose in 2011. DuVall has done Alice in Chains justice in my opinion. It goes without
      saying Staley can never be replaced.

    <h3>Notable Songs</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>We Die Young</li>
      <li>No Excuses</li>
      <li>Rooster</li>
      <ol>
     <p> My personal favorite is Heaven Beside You. But I would say all of their songs are worth an in-depth listen.
       Sometimes the lyrics are ugly but they reveal a beautiful truth. As drugs were prevalent amongst the band, a 
       majority of the songs deal with drug addiction. Cantrell, the most prominent lyricist in the band, would sing
       lead on songs that he primarily wrote. On a similar note, Cantrell has solo music that is pretty good.

        <h3>Concerts</h3>
        <p> I have had the pleasure of attending two of their concerts. Although not with the late Staley, the original
          lead singer, I have had the most wonderful times at these concerts. The energy and talent of this band is unparalleled.
          On songs that Cantrell takes the most credit for, DuVall takes a step back from the mic and lets Cantrell
          be center stage. As with all my other favorite bands from before the 2000s, I wish I was alive when I could've seen 
          them in their prime.
